# Financial Calculator

# Mortgage Calculator

So in the mortgage calculator we used the formula: 
M=P*(i*(1+i)^n / ((1+i) ^n)-1)

To find out how much their loan would make with 
a certain amount of interest and time 
would make over the years.

Users are able to insert their info thanks to the use of scanners. We also took the time to write the formula thanks 
to the help of Math.pow()

# Future Value Calculator

For future value we used:
FV = P × (1 + (r / 365))^(365 × t)

To determine how much money is earned within a certain amount of time. 

What I found interesting about both calculators is how java 
can be used for everyday stuff and stuffs you don't really think about coding. 
If you can't find something you're looking for then it's best to do it yourself 
thanks to the help of java.
